Game Description:

 - What is the main action in the game?
 -- The main action of the game is rolling a ball down a course in a traditional plinko manor. In this game the player controls a
yellow and black ball that moves left and right on the player's input. The normal pegs in plinko have been switch out for rotating
squares, this gives the game more strategy than the normal version of plinko as player's interaction can cause less collisions than
normal plinko, making the gameplay faster. The goal is to get to the bottom of the board and hit a golden rotating cube, which 
gives the player 5 points and teleports them to the top of the map. There is also an actor controlled by gravity and the player
colliding with it, when this actor gets to one of the gold cubes, it teleports to the top of the map and the player is given 10 
points. The goal of the game is to get to 100 points as quickly as possible.

 - What was the hardest part of the game to get working in Unreal?
 -- The hardest part of the game to get working was the sound and specifically volume control. I wanted a slider that changed the
volume of the music, but since the music was played on loop from the start and not set as a variable, I did not know how to do this.
Eventually I did change the sound to a variable where I was able to set the volume to the value of the slider in the pause menu.

 - What is the most interesting part of the game?
 -- The most interesting part of the game is that there are many strategies to get to 100 points. For example the player could try
and get themselves to the bottom as fast as possible, leaving the black ball to fall by itself for the occasional 10 points, or 
the player could try and push the black ball down with it, meaning the reward for reaching the bottom is effectively 15 points, 
or the player could leave the keyboard entirely and let gravity and physics do its thing for a slow victory.
